# ASJSG
A Simple Java Script Game !
its a simple javascript game, where you click the ball to make it bounce 
if the ball touches the ground its game over for you.

Its a physics/gravity simulation kind of thing, my first project after I learned java script. Its simple yet implements basic concepts of game design and java script in general.

# How do the mechanics work ? 

Basically, when you click on the ball, the force vector's direction will be from the point where you clicked on the ball to the center of the ball and the amount of the force will depend on how far from the center of the ball you are clicking.

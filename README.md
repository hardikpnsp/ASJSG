# ASJSG
A Simple Java Script Game !
its a simple javascript game, where you click the ball to make it bounce 
if the ball touches the ground its game over for you.

Its a physics/gravity simulation kind of thing, my first project after I learned java script. Its simple yet implements basic concepts of game design and java script in general.
